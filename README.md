# Blockchain Simulation Tasks

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating fundamental blockchain concepts through practical simulations.

## Files Included

1. **blockchain_simulation.py**
   - Builds a basic blockchain with 3 linked blocks  
   - Demonstrates how changing data in one block affects the whole chain

2. **mining_simulation.py**  
   - Simulates Proof-of-Work mining by finding a nonce that meets difficulty criteria  
   - Shows computational effort and time taken for mining

3. **consensus_demo.py**  
   - Simulates three consensus mechanisms: Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)  
   - Selects validators based on mock validator data

## Where to Run 

I used VSCODE and Python3 to do so

```bash
python blockchain_simulation.py
python mining_simulation.py
python consensus_demo.py
